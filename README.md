# Template-bot
this is a template bot with a command handler, ping command, and ping prefix

  **BEFORE you try to run this bot there are things you have to do**

1. install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)

2. install some sort of code editor ([Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.5.6.html), [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [VS-Code (recommended)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))

3. put your bot token in the config.js

4. add a prefix to the bot.js

5. double click install.bat (installs all the needed modules for the bot as well as creates the runbot.bat)

6. enjoy the bot (it's just a template tho)
