# template-discord-bot
this is a template bot with a command handler, ping command, and customizable prefix

## Setting up

1. Install the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) framework.
2. (OPTINONAL) Install and use one of these editors, [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.5.6.html), [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/3), [Atom](https://atom.io/), or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
3. Create a folder on your desktop (or anywhere) to put your bot code in... (no spaces in the file name, spaces will throw errors).
4. Open a terminal in the directory you just created, like powershell or cmd.
    [PS. for the VSCode users try using the [integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal)]
5. In terminal run "npm init" then go through that. When it's completed try running npm i discord.js, that shall install the discord.js libary that we can use later...
6. Once that is done this shall necessarily make 2 files and 1 folder. The 2 files package.json and package-lock.json, and the 1 folder node_modules folder.
7. Open up config.js and replace the templates with your bot TOKEN and PREFIX, than you could edit bot.js with what ever you desire... feel free to add more commands in the commands folder as well.
8. Your template bot is all set to go if you followed these steps correctly...
