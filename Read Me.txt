        **BEFORE you try to run this bot there are things you have to do**

1. install node.js => https://nodejs.org/en/

2. install some sort of code editor (Notepad++, Sublime, Atom, VS-Code)
	Notepad++ => https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.5.6.html
	Sublime => https://www.sublimetext.com/3
	Atom => https://atom.io/
	VS-Code (recommended) => https://code.visualstudio.com/download

3. create a folder on your desktop to put the bot in (no spaces in the name, spaces will throw errors)

4. open command prompt and navigate to the folder you just created 
	[cd desktop /then cd <folder name>]

5. type "npm init" and spam enter (everything can be changed later)
	once you're done with that type "npm i discord.js" [installs the discord.j library for the bot]
	after it's done type "npm i fs" [re-installs fs]

6. open the folder you created on your desktop for the bot, you should see a "node-modues" folder
   along with a "package.json" and a "package-lock.json" ... remember step 5?, ya well .. all the
   npm init did was create the package.json, so you can open it to edit the things

7. edit the config.js for your bot token and bot.js for the default prefix

8. enjoy the bot (it's just a template tho)
